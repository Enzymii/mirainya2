# mirainya2

A new version of typescript QQ bot SDK based on `mirai-api-http v2`

This repo is under quite slow construction

Trying my best to make progress every day

## Usage

Firstly you need to guarantee that you have the `mirai-api-http^2` env

Currently you can clone the repo test it in `index.ts` by modifying the code

When I finish this I will publish it to `npm`, so `npm install mirainya2` should be available then.
